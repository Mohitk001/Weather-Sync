# Weather Sync

[Live Demo](https://mohitk001.github.io/Weather-Sync/)

**Weather Sync** is a sleek, modern weather application that combines advanced features with an intuitive, visually captivating user interface. It‚Äôs not just about checking the weather; it‚Äôs about delivering a seamless user experience through engaging design and unique interactions. 

## Features

- **Voice Input for City Search** üé§: No more typing! Users can simply speak the name of the city or country to get real-time weather updates.
  
- **Dynamic Weather Icons** ‚õÖ: Weather Sync automatically updates icons based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

- **Immersive Background Videos** üé¨: The standout feature of Weather Sync is the visually immersive background video that adapts to the weather condition. For instance, a sunny day will display a bright, vibrant video, while a rainy day will show a calm, rain-themed video. This feature enhances the overall user experience and makes the app truly unique.

- **Responsive Design** üì±: The application is fully responsive, offering a fluid and seamless experience across devices‚Äîwhether you're on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

- **Error Handling** ‚ùó: Invalid city names trigger a polite error message, keeping the user informed without breaking the experience.

## Why Weather Sync Stands Out

Unlike traditional weather apps, **Weather Sync** places a huge emphasis on both **UI and UX**. The design isn't just functional; it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing and emotionally engaging. Key aspects that make **Weather Sync** stand out include:

- **Visual Feedback with Video Integration**: Instead of static backgrounds, we use real-time video that aligns with the weather. It‚Äôs like looking out of your window no matter where you are.

- **Effortless Interaction**: By incorporating voice recognition, users experience a smoother, more natural way to interact with the app. This reduces friction, particularly in mobile use.

- **User-Centric Design**: With clean layouts, easy navigation, and a focus on accessibility, **Weather Sync** provides a user-friendly experience.

- **Focus on Emotional Design**: The background videos are curated not only to reflect the weather but to evoke the emotions associated with different weather conditions, creating a more immersive and personal experience for the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for responsive, gradient-based, and video-enabled design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for dynamic weather fetching and interaction handling
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for real-time weather data
- **Speech Recognition API** for voice input functionality
- **Figma** for UI/UX prototyping

## How to Use

1. Open the live [Weather Sync app](https://mohitk001.github.io/Weather-Sync/).
2. Type or **speak** the name of the city.
3. Instantly view the current weather with a corresponding background video and weather icons.
4. The UI adapts based on the conditions, providing a dynamic and engaging experience.
